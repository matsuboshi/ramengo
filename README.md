# LET THE GAMES BEGIN with RAMENGO

This repository is an attempt to showcase few of my Golang skills. Let the games begin!

## Setup

Requires Go 1.22.2 or greater.

## How to run

Just run the following command:

    go run ./cmd/api

And do the regular CURLs on `localhost:8080`. <br>
Happy testing!
